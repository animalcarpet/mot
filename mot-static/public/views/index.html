          <h2 id="why">Why a pattern library?</h2>
          <p>The pattern library is a reference tool for designers and developers that contains all the design elements that appear multiple times across the application. It documents the code, look, and behaviour of the components and is important for a number of reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>it increases the understanding of the application through consistent naming and pattern reuse</li>
            <li>reduces cognative load on users through pattern reuse</li>
            <li>it gives designers and developers the building blocks to quickly build complex interactions</li>
            <li>it facilitates rapid prototyping of new ideas</li>
            <li>improves the consistency across the application</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="dev">How can a developer use it?</h2>
          <p>The pattern library acts as a functional specification for developers. Each pattern will detail the html code, the expected behaviour on interaction, and when and where the pattern should be used. </p>
          <p>Developers can match the patterns found in UX Pin to those in the pattern library and lift the corresponding code to build the component. This ensures that shared componets are built in a consistent manor and in turn improving the user experience. </p>
          <h2 id="BA-PO">How can a BA/PO use it?</h2>
          <p>The main focus for the BA/PO is understanding when and where to use a pattern. By referencing the pattern library BA/PO's can look for existing patterns that match the needs for their story. </p>
          <p>Pattern names play an important part as they create a shared vocabulary across teams. This will result in improved communication of ideas as different regions of the site can be refered too and everyone will have a shared understanding of what that area might look and behave like.</p>
          <h2 id="changes">Changes to the pattern library</h2>
          <p>You can request a change to a pattern or a <a href="mailto:d.bair@kainos.com?subject=Web%20pattern%20library%20ADDITION">request a new pattern</a> if you feel the requirements for the story are not met. New patterns come at a cost as they require some design, development, and add an additional load on users to interpret another pattern. </p>
          <h3></h3>
          <p>Patterns will only be created or extended when there is a sound business case for doing so. Before a change or addition can be made you must provide evidence to show why an existing pattern cannot be used. You must also state the business/user needs for the change or additional pattern. If a developer is requesting the change they must get sign off from both the BA and PO, if a BA is requesting the change then sign off must be recieved from the PO.</p>
          <p>Once sign off has been approved a UX team member will come up with a design solution and ensure all parties are happy with the new pattern. The pattern will then be presented to the wider UX team to ensure consistency with the application before being approved for entry into the pattern library.</p>
          <h3>Change log</h3>
          <p>Any changes made to the style guide must be added to the <a href="change-log">change log</a> table.
