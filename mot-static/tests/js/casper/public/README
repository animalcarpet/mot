This is an internal public directory used by a node express server
to host the local casper fixtures in phantomjs.

This is a quick way to host content that is required by caspar during testing.

The javascript files in this folder can be ignored, they will be built
using a grunt command and can be deleted once that piece of work is done.

The express app runs on port 3900 and is accesable via localhost:3900.

It only fires up during the grunt test:casper command and closes back down afterwards.
