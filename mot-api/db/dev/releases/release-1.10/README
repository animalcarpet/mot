This folder contains SQL scripts that should be run to bring the database from
1.9.5-hotfix-3 to 1.9.10.

Each script should be ran in sequence, as per the output ls `ls -1`

Please note that there is one script that should not be applied to production, as it has been manually applied already:—

 * NOT_FOR_PROD_mot_test_hist+trigger_update.sql

This _may_ need to be applied to other environments so is included here for completeness.

You can easily load just the numbered scripts for production “[0-9]*sql” or all the scripts “*.sql” as required.
