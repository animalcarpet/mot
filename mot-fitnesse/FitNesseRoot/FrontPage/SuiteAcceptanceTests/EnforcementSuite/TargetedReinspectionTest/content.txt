!note The testLinkage? column should return true to indicate that every RFR entry in the V test refers to the original NT test. This shows confidence that the underlying database is correct and that the API is also correctly handling it.
 * Data under test is obtained via the API call: `/mot-test/N/compare` where `N` is the Vehicle Examiner test database identity value.
 * This at least allows us to ensure that the API wrapper classes are returning the expected data from the fixture data.
 * This is brittle and ideally we should be able to create both the NT and VE tests from this page.
