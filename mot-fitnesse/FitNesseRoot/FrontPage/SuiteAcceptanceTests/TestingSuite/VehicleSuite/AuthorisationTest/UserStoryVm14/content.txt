'''In order to do the class 4 test as a Tester I want \ need to be able to log onto my device'''

This test will call the Session method on the API to simulate a login. Note that client side UI will prevent null passwords being sent. The API just deals with valid tester, tester with wrong password etc.

!*** Result codes:

 * 1 - Successful login
 * -1 - Unknown user
 * -3 - Wrong password
