!contents -R2 -g -p -f -h

In order to use the PRS function when testing a vehicle as a tester I require the system to print out a fail and then a pass document at the same time for this test.

This test creates and follows through the entire process of making an MOT Test.
The odometer is set to 1000 mi, the brake tests are assumed to pass.

This test is supposed to check the output status of a test depending on RFR types and if in case of PRS the test creates a twin PASSED test with cloned advisories.

INPUTS: Rfr Fail, Rfr Prs, Rfr Advisory - IDs of RFRs from DB.
OUTPUTS: Status of test, Check if has twin test, status of twin test and Advisory from the twin test (to check if it's being preserved).
